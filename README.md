# 434Impressionist

Created by Alexandra Boukhvalova for CMSC434 at UMD.

This app is created to allow users to draw their own "impressionist" version of an uploaded picture using a variety of brush styles. In my app, I used an off-screen bitmap and canvas to draw to those by grabbing the pixel color at the corresponding location in the original picture. The four brush styles I implemented are simple small square, circle brush, line strokes, and velocity based squares. In order to change brushes, the user can select the brush button in the bottom menu bar and select any style they want. The user can also clear the painting by pressing the clear button or save it to the gallery with the save button. 

For the bonus feature in this app, I created a "Trace Background" functionality that pulls up an opaque pixelated version of the original image on the off-screen canvas. This allows the user to trace over certain parts of the image and use different brush styles based on the tracings.
